## General Information
In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
